# TudbuT License

The TudbuT Licenses are derived from the MIT License, with some constraints.

This README document is not legally binding, and merely a summary of the 
licenses.

Significant modifications, here, generally mean modifications which improve 
the user's or developer's experience.

## The Lesser TudbuT License (LTTL)

The Lesser TudbuT License is made to restrict selling and sublicensing. By
default, MIT allows anyone to sell or sublicense the software. With LTTL,
to do these, significant modifications must have been made in order to do so.

## The General TudbuT License (GTTL)

The General TudbuT License is made to completely forbid selling and 
sublicensing, while also forcing significantly modified copies of the software
to be made open-source under the same license, provided they are published in
binary form.

However, when the software's source is not modified, but more files are added
to it, the license does not apply to those => Libraries can be used without
publishing the application's source code.

## The Strong TudbuT License (STTL)

The Strong TudbuT License is made to completely forbid selling and 
sublicensing, while also forcing significantly modified copies of the software
to be made open-source under the same license as soon as they are run on a 
server or published in any other way.

However, when the software's source is not modified, but more files are added
to it, the license does not apply to those => Libraries can be used without
publishing the application's source code.

## Viral variants of the GTTL and STTL (GVTTL, SVTTL)

The General and Strong TudbuT Licenses have viral variants, in which any
software which builds upon the licensed software must also be made available
under the same license, including its source code being published => Using it
as a library means having to publish the application's source code.
